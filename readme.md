# The Recipe Box
**A basic CMS for storing recipes, written in Django.**

This is my first Django project, and it's a constant work in progress as I continue to learn. The front end is [available here](https://github.com/pmcghen/recipe-box), and you can see it in action at [pmcghen.github.io/recipe-box/](https://pmcghen.github.io/recipe-box/).

## Getting started

First thing's first, initialize and activate a virtualenv.

```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server.
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```
